Gauntlet is a card game prototype developed over 14 days. The main design philosophy was for a card game with more layers of gameplay interactions. This was explored through a sequence board which cards are played to. Other cards and the enemy have special effects depending on the state of the sequence board.

For example, the below card deals a large amount of damage if there are two red cards to its left when it is played to the sequence board.
